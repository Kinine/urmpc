urmpc

urmpc is a console MPD client written in Python using the urwid library. It is
heavily influenced by ncmpcpp, but aims to be more configurable and have less
feature bloat. For example, urmpc does not aspire to have a tag editor because
this violates one of Unix's central tenets (do one thing and do it well) and
because there are already many fine tag editors on the market.

This software is still under heavy development but already accomplishes nearly
everything the author needs on a typical day. Features such as search and saved
playlists are not yet implemented, however, so your mileage may vary.

When available, it is recommended to use your distribution's standard packaging
